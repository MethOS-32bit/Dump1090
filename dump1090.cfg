#
# A simple config-file for 'dump1090.exe'
#
# NOTES:
#
# *) Everything after a comment '#' gets ignored.
# *) All the below keys (string before the '=') are case-insensitive.
# *) All below values (string after the '=') are the default values unless stated otherwise.
# *) A '0' for numeric values means 'Infinite'.
# *) All the below key/values are parsed *before* the command-line gets parsed.
#    Hence any command-line option can override one of these settings.
#    E.g. option '--airports c:/foo/my-airport-codes.csv' will replace
#        the default '%~dp0\airport-codes.csv' below.
#
# *) A '%0' means the same as in a .BAT file; the full name of this .cfg-file.
# *) A '%~dp0' means the same as in a .BAT file; the directory of this .cfg-file.
# *) A '?' means to include this file if it exists.
#    include = ?dump1090-common.cfg
#
# *) But without the '?', include it always. If the file does not exists,
#    it's an error. Similar to how GNU-make does it: '-include foo.mak'.
#    include = dump1090-common.cfg
#
# *) A string with '%~dp0' gets expanded too:
#    message = "I am '%~dp0\dump1090.cfg'"
#
# *) Or a string with '%0':
#    message = "My full name is '%0'"

#
# General options:
#
airports  = %~dp0\airport-codes.csv      # The airports CSV database
aircrafts = %~dp0\aircraft-database.csv  # The aircrafts CSV database

#
# Re-download the above "aircrafts" file if older than 10 days from this URL.
# Then recreate the `$(aircrafts).sqlite' and exit the program.
# This can be done even when another 'dump1090.exe' is running with the same
# `$(aircrafts).sqlite' file.
