# A simple config-file for 'dump1090.exe'
#
# NOTES:
#
# *) Everything after a comment '#' gets ignored.
# *) All the below keys (string before the '=') are case-insensitive.
# *) All below values (string after the '=') are the default values unless stated otherwise.
# *) A '0' for numeric values means 'Infinite'.
# *) All the below key/values are parsed *before* the command-line gets parsed.
# *) A '%0' means the same as in a .BAT file; the full name of this .cfg-file.
# *) A '%~dp0' means nearly the same as in a .BAT file;
#    the directory of this .cfg-file. Except there is no '\' at the end.
# *) A '?' means to include this file if it exists.
#    include = ?dump1090-common.cfg
#
# *) Other to-do expansions:
#    %~nx0  - expand %0 to a file name and extension only
#    %~f0   - expand %0 to a fully qualified path name
#
# *) But without the '?', include it always. If the file does not exists,
#    it's an error. Similar to how GNU-make does it: '-include foo.mak'.
#    include = dump1090-common.cfg
#
# *) A string with '%~dp0' gets expanded too:
#    message = "I am '%~dp0\dump1090.cfg'"
#
# *) Or a string with '%0':
#    message = "My full name is '%0'"
